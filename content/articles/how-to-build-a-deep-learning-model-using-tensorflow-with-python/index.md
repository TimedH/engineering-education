### Prerequisites
To get along, you should ;
- Have a little knowledge about deep learning models and machine learning
- Be familiar with deep learning basics and how to go about it, you refer to this article [Introduction to Deep Learning](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/introduction-to-deep-learning/) to learn more about deep learning

### Introduction
Looking at the world today, youâ€™ll realize that many applications we use in our daily lives have been built using deep learning. Deep Learning Models create a network that resembles the biological nervous system. Frameworks used to build these deep learning models include Caffee, Microsoft cognitive tool, MXNET, Keras, DeepLearning4j, and Tensorflow. Keras and Tensorflow are the most used frameworks.

A lot has changed in deep learning, it's now much simpler to get into deep learning and work with deep learning models. Nowadays we have high-level APIs like Keras that sit on top of Tensorflow making it super simple. This article will take you through how to build a deep learning model using Tensorflow with Python.

#### **Importance of deep learning**
It can process several features, making it best to operate with unstructured data. As a result, deep learning technology can dramatically develop our day-to-day quality of life by helping us predict, plan, make, and apply better decisions.

With knowledge in modeling deep learning neural networks and a better understanding of probabilistic methods, one should start their career in deep learning with ease.
Some of the modeling deep learning neural networks that may be of great help in your career include ADAM, CNN, LSTM, Dropout, RNN, etc.

#### __What is Tensorflow?__
TensorFlow *is a free, open-source machine learning software that can be used from start to end.*
It has a large, flexible set of operators, libraries, and community resources that allow academics to advance the state-of-the-art in machine learning and developers to quickly construct and deploy machine learning applications.
Tensorflow was developed in 2015 by google.

#### **Merits and Demerits of TensorFlow**
The following are some of the advantages of Tensorflow ;

#### Merits
- Tensorflow is very compatible with many languages like;  Javascript, Python, C#, Swift, C++, and Ruby; hence the user may choose any language to use with Tensorflow.
- TensorFlow is used for deep learning development because it allows the creation of neural networks using graphs that represent operations as nodes. It operates in multiple domains, including motion detection, image recognition, time series, voice detection, and many others, thus meeting users' needs. With that, it offers graphical support in deep learning.
- Tensorflow is Keras friendly. It is compatible with Keras, allowing users to program several high-level functionality areas. In addition, Keras will provide TensorFlow with system-specific functionality like pipelining, estimators, and eager execution.
- Tensorflow is an open-source and free platform accessible to all nearby users and is ready for any system upgrade.

#### Demerits
- TensorFlow has a low speed in relation to its competitors. It also has less usability compared to other components.
- TensorFlow has only NVIDIA support for GPU and python for GPU system support. It has no other support.
- TensorFlow delays in providing symbolic loops for endless sequences. It has a straightforward application, which makes it a worthwhile program. It is therefore known as a low-level API.
- It releases new versions every two to three months, increasing the time it takes for the user to install and integrate it with their existing system.

#### **Steps of Tensorflow Algorithm**
1. ***Import the data*** i.e
```python
import TensorFlow as tf
import TensorFlow_datasets as tendata
```

2. ***Transformation of data:*** prepares TensorFlow input data by introducing features that necessitate a full pass through the training dataset. The `tf.Transform()` function is used.


3. ***Set then initialize the variables and Placeholders:*** TensorFlow's basic programming elements include placeholders and variables. Data is injected into the graph at a later time using placeholders, whereas variables store the graph's state.

4. ***Develop a model structure:*** Here you build the model; the 2 ways of building a model include, a functional model and a sequential model. A sequential model is the most commonly used.

5. ***Set the Algorithm's Parameters and then define the Loss Function:*** Te algorithm's parameter will be set and later, we then define the loss function, a neural network tends to minimize the loss so the way that you calculate loss can make a huge impact because it's its relationship to your accuracy optimizer.

6. ***Train the model and analyze the performance:*** to train the model we'll use the  `model.fit()` function.

7. ***Make a prediction about the outcome:*** After training the model, one can predict out of it using the `model.predict()` function.

let's have an example;

```python
### we first import the data
import tensorflow as tf
              
 from tensorflow import keras
### we then go to transformation of data
fashiondata = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test)= fashiondata.load_data()
x_test.shape
x_train.shape
###here we set and initialize the variables and placeholders
x_train, x_test = x_train/255, x_test/255
### here is where we develop a model structure
model= tf.keras.model.sequential([tf.keras.layer.Flatten(input_shape=(28,28)),tf.keras.layer.Dense(128, activation =`relu`), tf.keras.layer.Dropout(0.2),tf.keras.layer.Dense(10, activation=`softmax`)])
### here is where we set the parameters and define the loss function
model.compile(optimizer= `adam`,loss=`sparse_categorical_crossentropy`, metrics[`accuracy`])
### training the model and analyse the performance
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)
model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
### we then make a prediction about the outcome
model.predict([x_test])
```

**NOTE:** You can save the model using the `model.save()` function.

#### Conclusion
Tensorflow has made coding look great; many deep learning models have been made through it. With the steps given, the reader will deploy a deep learning model using Tensorflow. I hope this article was of good help to you. The content is helpful to beginners and intermediate individuals practicing machine learning and deep learning.

For beginners, you'll have to do more coding to familiarise yourself with the procedures.
